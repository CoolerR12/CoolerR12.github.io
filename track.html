        <h1>Impression</h1>
        <p>
            Thanks to the full sized track, the field house is a great place to go if it is raining 
            outside and you want to go for a run. As well as playing basketball. With three courts to 
            play on, there is plenty of room for everyone to play. If someone wants to play volleyball 
            and has their own portable net then they can easily play here with each basketball court 
            having a volleyball court inside. With multiple activities that can be done in the field 
            house it only makes sense that it would be on our list. The field house is often used for 
            events which is why there are so many trash cans around. This helps to reduce the amount of 
            trash left behind by others which keeps it nice, clean, presentable.<br> The track alone helps inspire 
            people to be active, and with the basketball and volleyball courts inside the track, it's 
            hard to walk in here and not want to run around. As someone that played volleyball here in 
            high school, revisiting it brings back loads of memories. This can be true for anyone else, 
            all they need to do is go and have fun.

            <h1>History</h1>
        <p>
            The track was named 
            after John M. Baxter as he was “a standout track athlete in the late 1940s” (gorhody) 
            winning eight varsity letters and has supported URI athletics since his “graduation as a 
            top officer in the URI Foundation, Alumni Association, Athletic Council, and Century Club”
            (gorhody). He later became a successful insurance executive.
