    <p id="text">
        Upon entering the The Tootell Aquatic Center I noticed a large spacious well lit room with a high ceiling containing 3 varying pools. I was met with warm air with a strong aroma of chlorine. The building seems well maintained with a clean vibe, with an almost retro feel. 
        <br>Each pool served a different set of purposes. The first pool was a large shallow recreational pool, where children would take swim lessons and elderly would hang out. This pool seemed to be the most popular among the family crowd. Next the middle pool had four sets of diving boards, two taller boards with a height of three meters and two shorter ones at one meter. Here kids and teens would do fips as a line formed behind each board. The dive pool is 14 feet deep. The final pool was empty at the time but this is where they hold competitions of all different levels, this pool had 8 different lanes and had a depth of 7.5 feet.<br>
         Above this pool displayed on the wall are the top records held by the swimmers. The pools had a safe feel with certified lifeguards all around.<br>
         At the back a door leads to a large spacious locker room containing clothing lockers, showers and even a machine that dries off your wet swimwear. This room also seemed old but clean and well maintained.<br>
          Lastly overlooking these pools was a viewing balcony where parents or fans could oversee the pools, this seemed like a good spot to watch a swim meet from as you can see the entire pool from a better angle.
