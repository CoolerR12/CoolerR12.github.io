        Boss Ice Arena seems very timeless with a simple yet effective layout. The rink itself is rather new, built in 2002. As you walk in you enter a clean lobby area, to the right is the front desk and seating for gearing up for public skating. If you take a left it will lead to another larger lobby with couches, TVs, bubblers, and vending machines. Here you will find the URI Hockey trophy cases. On either side are doors leading to the locker rooms where hockey players will gear up. Heading through those halls are doors to enter the ice. The bleachers are aluminum so a bit cold but look nicer than plastic and are easy to maintain compared to wood.<br><br>
        There is quite a lot of seating and the bleachers wrap around the majority of the rink. Much like the architecture of the pool, the ceiling has large blue beams which match URIâ€™s colorway.<br><br>
        The building is well lit and the ice is kept bright. On the wall are banners of local teams' championships. A net surrounds most of the rink making it a safe viewing for fans. The boards are covered with local sponsors of the rink and a blue trim surrounds goes well with the theme.<br><br>
        The ice itself looks very nice and taken care of. The rink has two matching zambonis which seem relatively modern. The rink doesn't seem too cold in comparison to other rinks and overall has a nice clean minimalist feel.
