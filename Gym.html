            When I first walked into the gym I was not expecting much. However, I was 
            pleasantly surprised when I opened the door to see an amazing volleyball/basketball
            court that was surrounded by seats. Walking out to the middle of the court felt 
            amazing being in the middle of the stadium. All I could think about being here 
            was how amazing it would be to play volleyball in a stadium full of people.
            Keaney gymnasium often hosts women's volleyball games. This is shown by all 
            the womenâ€™s volleyball banners that are above the court. <br>
            Whenever I think about going to watch a game here I think about how there are three different
            types of seats; blue ones next to the court, yellow ones a story up 
            surrounding the court, and a bunch of benches behind the yellow seats. It 
            seems weird to have actual seats and then transition into benches. <br>
                    
            his gym was made to replace the old gym that was made 
            in the 1920s. It took URI 30 years to replace that gym but they have not built
            a new one in 70 years. With how the gym looks from the outside it is in 
            definite need of a makeover.

                Keaney gym is a very important building on campus. This building is located in 
                between the Ryan center, and the Ice hockey rink, and it is also a short walk 
                from Eddy and Weldin hall.  This building houses a numerous amount of sports 
                teams, as well as facilities for those teams. <br>
                Keaney gym is used by both the Mens
                and Womens volleyball teams, and contains locker rooms for baseball, soccer, 
                tennis, and track and field. It also has athletic offices for football, soccer, 
                baseball, golf, and tennis.

    <h1>History</h1>
    <div id="GymHis">
                <img id="Keaney" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Frank_Keaney.jpg/615px-Frank_Keaney.jpg?20190116014951" height="400">
                
                <p>
                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The gym is named after Frank Keaney, who coached 
                basketball from 1920, to 1940. He led them to an overall record of 401-124, or
                a winning percentage of .764 through 28 seasons. Keaney also coached the 
                football team from 1920 to 1940, and was the second-winningest football coach 
                in URI history. Keaney sadly passed away in 1967 at the age of 81. The Keaney 
                gym opened in 1953, and has a capacity of 3385 people. Even now, given the size 
                of the building, it serves as a perfect hub for anything athletic or sports 
                related. <br> <br>
                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Unbeknownst to many, Keaney gym used to hold concerts, with notable 
                artists such as The Beach Boys, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Bob Dylan. From 
                1967 to 1969 the gym used to hold the first round games for the NCAA tournament.
                Overall, Keaney has made a lasting impression on the University of Rhode Island,
                and I believe that this facility is a great way to honor his accomplishments.
