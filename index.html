    <a href="Gym.html"> <h2>Keaney Gym</h2></a>

        <p>At keaney gym there is a lot to do. Not only is there a gym with loads of equipment but there is also a basketball/volleyball court with seating that can hold over 3,000 people.<br>
        The court has a smaller court at the bottom of the U-shaped seating while the main basketball court also has a volleyball court inside of it. <br><br>
        The gym is extremely important as a lot of students use it while they live on campus. It has a wide variety of activities for students to partake in.
        With lots of cardio machines and lifting equipment, the freshmen 15 shouldn't exist or should be all muscle.

    <a href="Swimming.html"><h1>Tootell Aquatic Center</h1></a>
        <p>
            The aquatic center is in a very old yet spacious building that smells like chlorine. 
            Inside there is a shallow pool for kids, one with diving boards, and another for competetive swimming.
            There are four diving boards. Two tall ones and two small ones. The competetive swimming pool has eight lanes to swim in.
            With multiple lifeguards watching it is no wonder so many families come here.
