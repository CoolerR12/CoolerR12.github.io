        <p>At keaney gym there is a lot to do. Not only is there a gym with loads of equipment but there is also a basketball/volleyball court with seating that can hold over 3,000 people.<br>
        The court has a smaller court at the bottom of the U-shaped seating while the main basketball court also has a volleyball court inside of it. <br><br>
        The gym is extremely important as a lot of students use it while they live on campus. It has a wide variety of activities for students to partake in.
        With lots of cardio machines and lifting equipment, the freshmen 15 shouldn't exist or should be all muscle.
