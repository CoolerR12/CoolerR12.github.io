    <a href="Gym.html"> <h2>Keaney Gym</h2></a>

        <p>At keaney gym there is a lot to do. Not only is there a gym with loads of equipment but there is also a basketball/volleyball court with seating that can hold over 3,000 people.<br>
        The court has a smaller court at the bottom of the U-shaped seating while the main basketball court also has a volleyball court inside of it. <br><br>
        The gym is extremely important as a lot of students use it while they live on campus. It has a wide variety of activities for students to partake in.

    <a href="Swimming.html"><h1>Tootell Aquatic Center</h1></a>
        <p>
            The aquatic center is in a very old yet spacious building that smells like chlorine. 
            Inside there is a shallow pool for kids, one with diving boards, and another for competetive swimming.
            There are four diving boards. Two tall ones and two small ones. The competetive swimming pool has eight lanes to swim in.
            With multiple lifeguards watching it is no wonder so many families come here.

    <a href="BossIce.html"><h1>Boss Ice Arena</h1></a>
        <p>
         
            Unlike the other buildings this one is more modern. It is large and well lit.<br>
            The building is well maintained with a nice clean design.<br>
            Even though it is a ice rink the building is not too cold.

        These places serve as locations where students can improve their physical health. They exist to provide exercise and entertainment. Students and athletes visit these locations, for the purpose of being active and participating in what they enjoy. I visit these locations for the same reason, along with watching competitions like basketball games.<br><br>
The Mackal Field House contains an indoor track, basketball courts, and a weight room, along with other facilities. The building was opened in 1991 and was sponsored $500,000 by Henry H. Mackal. The facility cost around 8 million dollars to make, and took over ten years, according to the official URI website, “The completion of the $8 million Mackal facility in 1991 marked the culmination of a project over ten years in the making. <a href="https://web.uri.edu/campusrec/facilities/mackal-field-house/">Campus Recreation (uri.edu) </a> have been updated since then, so the resources are maintained and kept in good quality.<br><br>
The audience should visit these locations because they are bound to have a great time if they have the same interests. If they are looking for a place to exercise on campus, there is no place closer and cheaper than URI’s fitness buildings. According to Reiss, interviewed by WPRI.com, “We have that athleticism now so where we played in the half-court last year, defensively and offensively. We will press for 30-plus minutes this year. We will run and we will play fast and we will create havoc. It’s unleash the mayhem.”<a href="https://www.wpri.com/sports/college-sports/fans-get-first-look-at-uri-basketball-programs-at-hoopfest/"> Fans get first look at URI basketball programs at Hoopfest | WPRI.com.</a> Fans of basketball should visit the stadium to experience the men’s and women’s games, as they create an energetic environment that will get students pumped. Any student can visit a location, regardless of the sport or club they participate in. They can use these as spots to train if they are looking to get into a group.<br><br>
People planning to visit these locations in their free time as there are scheduled events that could be taking place, according to the official URI website, “Please note, that other activities, such as swim lessons and instructional classes, may be taking place in other pools during open hours.”<a href="https://web.uri.edu/campusrec/tootell-hours/"> Tootell Aquatic Center (TAC) – Campus Recreation (uri.edu).</a><br><br>


 It is advised that people bring their own supplies for the activity they plan to do, like water bottles or a change of clothes. They should make use of the schedules posted for each building and activity as they can plan when they want to show up. They schedules can also abruptly change without much notice, so that is another thing for students and athletes to be aware of. They can make the most of their experience by tagging along with friends to watch or participate in the athletic events being held.<br><br>
